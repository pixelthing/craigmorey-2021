In 1987 I bought a second-hand Tamiya Frog from a friend of a friend. It kicked off a teenage hobby in building a better mousetrap.

## 1. Marlboro man

Second hand meant badly built, badly painted and with worn tires. I didn't care - it was something completely new and I quickly painted over the outside of the shell (mmmm, brushstrokes), hand painted some logotypes on the wing and left pretty much everything else as stock.

## 2. Chenworth disaster

But that junky painted shell wasn't satisfying, and a new Tamiya body cost more than I was willing to pay, so I ordered a much cheaper Chenworth body for an RC10 - only to find that it would never fit a Frog, and so after some poor attempts and making a purse out of a sows ear, it ended up being held on by masking tape. The only change at this stage was swapping the rear balloon Frog wheels for some Hotshot knock-offs, and an SCR battery to replace the weird tamiya humpback pack.

## 3. Second chance

So, still pretty stock (mechanical speed control and all), it was time to bite the bullet and buy a proper Tamiya Frog shell. It was the nineties and for some reason an electric pink body was my choice of paintjob (a bad one - it fades in a really nasty way). But even though it was still a mechanical speed control, it was getting some upgrades - a better heatsink, a Demon 27T motor, and eventually some weird upgrades - Yokomo rear rims, reverse rim Tamiya Bigwig wheels on the front, and replacing the front suspension springs with plastic Meteor damped shocks on a the front, mounted on home-spun aluminium towers (another bad idea - aluminium bends. A lot). And finally a Nosram electronic speed control made an appearance.

## 4. Gearbox hyjinx

It was about this time I was starting to learn from all the mistakes. The experimentation became more serious, and it was time to fix the biggest problem inherent with the Frog - the high centre of gravity. One day it occured to me that the gearbox could be flipped upside-down and because the side plates were the same side-to-side, the motor could still be mounted to give the correct direction - but it would now be down near the ground. It was a breakthrough - and I just needed to figure out how to mount suspension on chassis mounts where there were none. In the end an Astute/Madcap read wishbone suspension was added (with Schumacher shocks), hanging off fibreglass plates mounted to the gearbox. The front suspension was also a frankenstein of Tamiya/Schumacher bits, also hanging off a fibreglass tower screwed into the plastic chassis. But it didn't quite all seem like a good package yet.

## 5. The ultimate

The end game for me was to move the battery to be longtitudinal, underneath a hinged aluminium tray that held the speed control and front steering servo. It meant disconnectign the steering and swinging open the tray when I needed to take the battery out, but it tidied the whole build. Along with some beefed up parts, it was a wide, stretched, low to the ground tarmac eater - still recognisable as a Frog, although I chopped the body to fit closer to the chassis - giving it a mean look.
