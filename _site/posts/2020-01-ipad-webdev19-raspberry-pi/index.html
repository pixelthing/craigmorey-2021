<p><a href="https://medium.com/sausheong/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-4-as-an-development-machine-for-your-ipad-pro-3813f872fccc">This Medium article</a> (paywall, unfirtunately) is the best resource I’ve found for setting up all the possible iPad/Pi combinations.</p>
</aside>
<p>This could qualify as one of the hacks of the year and has gained quite a lot of traction in the last six months.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty simple. Once you’ve got used to playing with a VPS (Virtual Private Server — a remote Linux account you rent) as the web development accessory to your iPad, you start to wonder if that Linux server could be closer to you. Much closer. And smaller — almost as if you could carry it in your pocket.</p>
<p>Well, that describes a Raspberry Pi. Of course any UNIX/Linux computer would do, but it just so happens that Pi’s are cheap ($€£35–100 depending on the level of spec and comfort) and very well supported with community documentation.</p>
<p>I’d been playing with Raspberry Pi’s as part of dashboard appliances, and was just considering using them as an off-board Linux server to a iPad when I realised smarter people were way ahead of me. The first time I saw a Raspberry Pi used specifically for development with an iPad, it was from the supremely talented Brent Jackson in July:</p>
<p>It blew my mind because I’m not sure how he’d arrived at it, but it was a fully formed workflow using USB-C to not only power the Pi, but as ethernet over USB as well (he even documented the types of cable he had success with and those that didn’t work out). Here’s <a href="https://threader.app/thread/1147555688933154816">the whole Twitter thread on Threader</a>.</p>
<p>It took off from there. I had an iPad Pro 10.5” with Lighning connectors, so USB-C power and network weren’t going to work for me, but I could connect to them over WiFi easily enough. And I found I didn’t need to stretch to the Pi 4B, the Pi 3B+ model that I already owned was fast enough for most work, and as a bonus had much lower power demands, so using a 10Ah 12Watt Anker battery pack (not a PD one with crazy output) was enough to run it. If you plugged it into a monitor, it would complain about power during boot-up, but in general headless usage, it never hit any limits.</p>
<p>For a plane trip in September, I decided to try and get it working without any internet — just the iPad, the Pi and the battery pack, totally off-line. I eventually got the Pi to act as a WiFi NAT and DHCP server, essentially acting as a router with no connection to route, leaving just the iPad and the Pi as the only IPs on our mini network. It worked great and I could literally carry it in my pocket whilst working on it. If you’d like to try this “offline” set-up, there’s a link at the bottom of this article.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://secureshellfish.app/">Secure Shellfish</a> came out, sending files to and from a Raspberry Pi was as easy as if it was an external drive, Shellfish just made it another file provider in the “Files” app.</p>
<p>Shellfish set-up to connect to my Rasbperry Pi 3B+<br>
And since Brent’s first tweet, I’ve seen the Pi pop up again and again as an iPad accessory. Rob at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT-GpMtIFhX9EMA0Eauevhw">TechCraft YouTube channel</a> has made several videos about setting up the Pi for use with an iPad, both with USB-C and Wifi connections. In fact, I’m not going to try to explain the set-up, because he does a much better job.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros <a class="direct-link" href="#pros">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You get a full Linux server that you can customise in any way you want.</li>
<li>It’s ridiculously portable, and can even be used in a workflow when you’re fully offline, under battery power.</li>
<li>Unlike a VPS, the quality of your internet connection is of no consequence.</li>
<li>You can buy and own it for less than the cost of one years’ rental of a cheap VPS.<br>
Geek cred.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons <a class="direct-link" href="#cons">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s another thing to carry, another thing to charge, another thing that can be damaged or lost.</li>
<li>You need to be willing to get pretty dirty with Linux command line</li>
<li>Back-up is your responsibility.</li>
<li>The Pi 4B can get pretty hot — best to bare in mind that if you need to stay mobile, it won’t appreciate working in a pocket or a bag for long periods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-extras">Optional extras <a class="direct-link" href="#optional-extras">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You can spec or modify these suckers until your heart’s content.</li>
<li>Tether it with USB-C for charging and network? Use Wi-Fi+battery and leave it in the bag? It’s up to you what works best.</li>
<li>Using a Raspberry Pi with the <a href="https://medium.com/p/18f482f3a976">VPS/VSCode method</a> would be pretty knockout. You might want to use a higher spec Pi 4B with some decent memory though.</li>
<li>You might want to use the Raspberry Pi as your development process, and then the CD/Netlify method as the next step, when you want to deploy your code to stage or production.</li>
